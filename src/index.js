import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')); 

// in index.html, rendering 'app.js' and 'reacting' all rsc into 'div' class, named root.
// thats is why it is called 'react js'. real-time reacting all sources into html.
// so no need to make a index. html and load it. it is synchronized it self

// DOM :: document object model.
